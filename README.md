# FAQs

#### Q: Why should I use this fibonacci generator?

A: It is *enterprise quality*, meaning that when you run fib.py, you aren't just getting a fibonacci generator using tuple unpacking or some other dumb, concise method, you're only getting the best of a tried and true robust framework suitable for production code.

#### Q: Why is this repo so large? 30 Mb seems like a lot.

A: As mentioned before, this isn't something thrown together in 2 seconds for Project Euler, this is a robust, modular framework for fibonacci generation. And remember: *Bigger means more enterprise*.

#### Q: Is this reflective of your acutal coding ability?

A: This is just a joke. I swear.
